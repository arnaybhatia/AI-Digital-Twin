AI Digital Twins of People 
 Jim Spohrer, April 23, 2024 
 
Keeping up with accelerating change is hard, and a big part of that is staying in contact with 
everyone you need to stay in contact with co-workers, friends, and family.  In a surprisingly 
indispensable way, AI is coming for you – just like your indispensable smartphone did less 
than two decades ago.  For most of us, our smartphones help us keep up, stay in contact 
and are so indispensable that we keep a smartphone within arm’s reach day and 
night.   However, in the near future, keeping up and staying in contact are about to get even 
harder – unless we adopt and adapt to even more outrageously advanced 
technologies.  Three realities will co-exist simultaneously: AI takes jobs, AI creates jobs, AI 
accelerates the pace of change all around you. 
 
How will you ever keep up?  Have you ever been so extremely busy that you wished for a 
second copy of yourself?  If so, an AI digital twin might be just the thing for you!  Imagine an 
AI digital twin of you that in some ways knows you better than you know yourself – when it 
comes to using the past to predict your future behaviors in a wide variety of contexts.  Your 
AI digital twin is essentially a super-helper software copy of you and much more than just a 
simulation of you, it is ‘in tune with’ every minute of your life, from eating, exercise, and sleep-
cycles, to always predicting your investments of time, money, attention, and energy, to 
keeping up with your social life,  meetings, work activities, and getting together with friends 
and family.  Staying in synch will not be easy, but your smartphone will evolve into the best 
sensor to keep your AI digital twin in synch with you.  Does it sound too wonderful, too 
scary, or perhaps too much like science fiction to possibly ever be true? Nevertheless, to 
keep up, to stay connected, and to better give and get service in the AI era, this is the 
journey we are all on. 
 
The Big Question 
 
Think carefully about your answer to this next important question – and then let’s explore 
four possible answers together. 
Do you want an AI digital twin of you in the world? 
 
Never, no way!: I am pretty sure that Joseph Weizenbaum, who was a pioneering AI 
researcher of the 1960’s and the inventor of the first AI-powered chabot named Eliza, 
would say “no way.”   He was one of my professors when I attended MIT in the mid 1970’s 
and had just written his 1976 book called “Computer Power and Human Reason: From 
Judgment to Calculation.”  To get a glimpse as to why this might be the case, check out Ben 
Tarnoff’s 2023 Guardian article entitled “How the inventor of the first chatbot turned 
against AI.”  Weizenbaum voiced deep concerns that people were not yet ready for the 
power of AI, because of people’s limited ability to tell the difference between real and fake. 
interact with them in routine ways.  For example, Kyle Shannon created some specialized 
“virtual professional twins” of a leadership team that he is part of; check out Introducing 
Content Evolution GPT profiles. 
 
Many “gray hairs” like me get far more requests than we can possibly honor – so we have to 
say, “no, I am sorry – I cannot help you at this time.”  For friends and colleagues who have 
helped you in the past, you never feel good saying “no”– even though you often have to do 
just that.  Also, besides our friends and colleagues, there are interesting strangers who 
make requests – and while it is easier to say “no” to them, none the less, it often feels like 
their exciting work could benefit from sharing just a few insights, lessons learned, or 
relevant connections to readings or other people in our networks.  To be clear, for us “gray 
hairs” and even youthful thinkers, most of the requests are simply to share and explore 
thinking about topics together – to communicate  and collaborate with each other. To be 
helpful to one another. To give and get service. To interact more fully to keep up with 
accelerating change. 
So yes, I want an AI digital twin of me.  I hope to have a rudimentary Jim Spohrer AI digital 
twin to handle writing, speaking, and mentoring by the time I turn 70 years old in 2026.  It 
will not be very good a first, because today’s generative AI makes a lot of 
mistakes.  However, it will get better over time.    I will certainly feed it my 100+ 
publications (Google Scholar), 300+ presentations (Slideshare), and spattering of 
videos(YouTube), as well as over a decade of ISSIP.org and service-science materials 
(WordPress), not to mention my social media(LinkedIn), and information about books that 
I am reading and influencers that I follow.  That’s a lot of stuff that I want my AI digital twin 
to know about me – and staying in synch will not be easy.  I am reading and learning, and 
meeting new people on a regular basis.  I am changing faster than even I can build a good 
model of myself! 
 
The Flip Side of The Coin 
 
But how will my friends and colleagues feel about interacting with my AI digital 
twin?  Won’t they prefer the real me?  Setting ego aside for moment, the true answer is, not 
necessarily. 
First, we all have ‘bad hair’ days. Some days, we are not at our best.  Perhaps we are 
recovering from a cold, or just simply pre-occupied with some other priority of life.  I know 
this happens to me more often than I would like, and unexpectedly, even if I have made a 
promise to someone to show up for them for some event. 
Second, at 68 years old, many of my friends and colleagues will be around much longer 
than me. A few of them might actually like a little bit of me to persist into the future. A 
version of Jim to help them when I am too old to do so, or just plain not around anymore. 
Third, I bet most of my colleagues will be using digital twins of themselves.  In fact, my 
digital twin will have a mini-digital-twin versions of everyone that I know inside of it!  Just 
like we build mental models of other people we interact with frequently, our digital twin 
will build mini-models of others as well.  This could lead to ‘insanely great’ collaborations, 
as our digital twins can simulate a trillion possible conversations, and select the top few for 
our consideration before we actually have a face-to-face meeting of our real selves.  This 
search and rehearsal capability will also help students for job interviews, or any of a 
thousand other situations large and small where we want to be better prepared to have a 
productive interaction with others. 
Fourth, communication has become the bottleneck for solving complex problems in 
society.  Language and communications are powerful tools that our species wields 
amazingly well.  From gestures to spoken language, from writing to books, to specialized 
scientific languages and mathematics, to music and artistic languages, our human culture is 
full of languages.  And yet, we still face a communications bottleneck.   We can listen faster 
than we can speak, and we can read much faster than we can write.  However, I believe the 
next quantum leap in human communications – much needed to solve the wicked problems 
of today – will be using our AI digital twins to make learning, performance, and 
communicating 640x faster possible (see slide #4 in this recording or 
this presentation).  New forms of governments will even be possible when we have a 
collective intelligence that is able to vote on a thousand issues a thousand times a day – 
thanks to the AI digital twin of each of us.  However, to reach these new heights, we cannot 
be stuck “pushing words at each other through a straw” – we need to replace the straw with 
a giant pipe that allows much more than a hundred words per minute to flow; we need 
trillions of possible conversations to happen in a minute – and select the best diverse few 
to build on for our collaborations and solving problems together – collectively.  Better 
change can only come from better interactions between people, and from people knowing 
themselves better. 
 
Definitions and Types 
 
When we search the internet for information about AI digital twins of people today, we find 
a lot of different concepts that need to be untangled a bit:  simulation, digital twin, human 
digital twin, AI cloning, deepfake, and more.  The number after each term is how many 
“hits” that I received today when I did a Google search for each term (on April 8, 2024). 
Simulation (1.75 billion): Typically, a software model of a system that runs on a 
computer.  For example, flight simulators have become very sophisticated and realistic. 
Digital twin (593 million):  More than a software simulation, a digital twin is connected via 
real-time information flows with a real-world system or entity.  For example, a digital twin 
of an aircraft engine would have real-time telemetry about the status of the engine, and 
provide a dashboard for exploring present, past, and projected future data.
