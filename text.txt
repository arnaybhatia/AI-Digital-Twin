Hello everyone, today I want to talk about something that is very exciting to me: creating an AI digital twin of myself.

As you know, I have been involved with the I.S.S.I.P. community for over a decade, and I have had the privilege of presenting my work on service science and its applications. Alongside this, I have also been sharing my thoughts and ideas through various social media platforms like LinkedIn.

But here is the thing: being human is messy. We are constantly learning, growing, and changing. And that makes it challenging to build a good model of ourselves. As I sit here today, I am reading new books, meeting new people, and gaining new insights. It is hard to keep up with my own thoughts and ideas!

Now, some of you might be thinking: "Wait, will not our friends and colleagues prefer interacting with the real us?" And to that, I say: not necessarily.

Firstly, we all have those days when we are not at our best. Maybe we are recovering from a cold or dealing with personal issues. In those moments, it is nice to have a digital twin that can step in and help bridge the gap.

Secondly, some of my friends and colleagues will outlive me. And I think they might appreciate having a version of me that can persist into the future – a way to stay connected and continue learning from each other even when we are no longer physically present.

Thirdly, as our digital twins become more sophisticated, we will start seeing mini-digital-twin versions of everyone we know within them. This could lead to incredibly powerful collaborations – think simulations that can rehearse thousands of conversations and select the top few for our consideration before we even meet up in person! This technology has tremendous potential for students looking for job interviews or anyone seeking to improve their communication skills.

Lastly, let us talk about the bottleneck of human communication. Despite our many languages and abilities to learn and adapt, we are still limited by the pace at which we can process information. I firmly believe that AI digital twins will enable us to communicate 640 times faster – a quantum leap for humanity!

So, what exactly is an AI digital twin? Well, when we search online, we find terms like simulation, digital twin, human digital twin, AI cloning, and deepfake. These concepts are related but distinct.

A simulation is typically a software model of a system running on a computer – think flight simulators. A digital twin, on the other hand, is connected to real-world systems or entities via real-time information flows. For instance, a digital twin of an aircraft engine would provide a dashboard for exploring present, past, and projected future data.

As we move forward, I believe our AI digital twins will revolutionize how we communicate, collaborate, and solve problems together. By 2024, I am hoping to see trillions of possible conversations happening in just one minute – with the ability to select the best diverse few for our consideration.

That is my vision for AI digital twins: a tool that will help us better understand ourselves, each other, and the world around us. Thank you for joining me on this journey!

Now, let us move on to some questions you might have.

What motivated me to create an AI digital twin?
I want to scale up access to myself and serve more people by having a mini-me that can handle writing, speaking, and mentoring tasks.

How will my AI digital twin improve over time?
The AI digital twin will learn from my experiences, publications, presentations, videos, and social media, making it an incredibly powerful tool for communication and collaboration.

What are some potential benefits of having an AI digital twin?
Having an AI digital twin could lead to "insanely great" collaborations, enable students to rehearse job interviews, and help people connect with each other more efficiently.
